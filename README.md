# Parkinson-s-disease-prediction

Parkinson disease, the second most common neurological disorder that causes significant disability,
reduces the quality of life and has no cure. Approximately, 90% affected people with Parkinson have speech disorders. 
The medical dataset contains heterogeneous data in the form of text, numbers, and images that can be mined. 
Big Data has the potential to give valuable information after processing that can be discovered through deep analysis
and efficient processing of data by decision-makers. Data mining is the process of selecting, extracting, and modeling
the unknown hidden patterns from large datasets. Machine learning algorithm (MLA) can be used for early detection of disease 
to increase the chances of elderly peopleâ€™s lifespan and improved lifestyle with Parkinson. In this, we use deep learning
that can help in improving the performance of datasets and play a vital role in making the early prediction of disease at right time.
